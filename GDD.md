## History

The idea of the game is a planetary traveller which name is P1 who in this opportunity is in a far away planet full of evil flies and slimes. Our character can't thouch any of this creatures or he will die. The way the player can help our brave traveler to keep alive, is by jumping using the up arrow key or by squatting using the down arrow key. The goal is to advance as much as possible into this planet, but we have to be careful, because as our hero advances, his enemies gets more and more furious and advance to him increasingly faster.

The background music is an 8-bit mp3 file conveniently trimmed to play in a loop reinforcing the idea of the endless runner.

## Main characther

 The main character is an endless runner and is affected by the gravity of the planet, so the player has to calculate when to jump to avoid touching the slimes, because jumping too early could cause he accidentally land over one of them,
