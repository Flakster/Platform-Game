# Platform-Game
This is a classic 2D platform game built with Javascript and Phaser 3. Very similar to the Chrome jumping dinosaur. The high scores are stored in and retrieved from an leaderboard service API.

The game consists of our main character, a planetary traveller called P1, who this time is running over the surface of a far away planet populated by evil flies and slimes. Our voyager should avoid touching this creatures by jumping (up arrow) and squating (down arrow) according to the case. The goal is advance as much as possible into the planet.
